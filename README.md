# IT Department Dashboard

An interactive web app dashboard built with **Flask**, developed during my internship. This tool helps streamline IT operations and provides an easy way for the team to manage data and track key metrics.

## Features

- **Microsoft Graph API Integration**: Access and manage data from Microsoft services like Outlook and Teams.
- **Absence & Metrics Tracking**: Keep track of staff absences and monitor other performance metrics.
- **Customizable Dashboard**: Tailor the layout and features to suit your departmentâ€™s specific needs.
- **Data Management**: Input, store, and retrieve data easily.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple to use for team members of any technical skill level.
